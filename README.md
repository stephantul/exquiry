  EXQUIRY
</h2>

This is a simple lexical expansion module that implements multiple methods for query or document expansion. It is intended to be used with sparse information retrieval (IR). This package does very little actual things, but groups a bunch of methods under a common framework, which can be useful for testing or comparisons.

# What is this for?

Sparse document representations suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem: documents that do not share any terms will have a similarity (or score) of 0, and will not be retrievable. This is especially difficult in the context of information retrieval, because queries and the documents that answer them do not necessarily share any tokens. For example, the query

```
"heart attack symptoms"
```

does not match the document

```
"Myocardial infarction typically presents with chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and sweating."
```

at all.

Document expansion is a simple set of techniques to counter this shortcoming: at either query or indexing time, we run document expansion models, which augment the document (i.e., either the query or the document) with additional terms. If done at indexing time, document expansion usually adds _terms that are likely to occur in the query_, while if done at query time, it usually adds synonyms and other terms that increase coverage.

For example, `tilde` (see below) will augment `"heart attack symptoms"` with:

```
'chest'
'blood'
'include'
'signs'
'may'
'pain'
'weakness'
'heartbeat'
'faint'
'breath'
```

Which leads to a non-zero similarity with the document above, because Tilde already expands the query to the actual symptoms.

# What does it contain?

It currently implements the following expanders:
- [tilde](https://github.com/ielab/TILDE)
- [doctttttquery](https://github.com/castorini/docTTTTTquery) (restyled as t5doc2query)

Note that `doctttttquery` is mostly suited for expanding documents into queries that relate to that documents (i.e., index-time expansion), while `tilde` can be used for both.

The default models for all expanders are as follows:

| Expander         | Default Model                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| TILDE            | [ielab/TILDE](https://huggingface.co/ielab/TILDE)  |
| t5doc2query      | [castorini/doc2query-t5-base-msmarco](https://huggingface.co/castorini/doc2query-t5-base-msmarco) |

# Installation

The package is not on pypi yet, use the following:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/stephantul/exquiry.git
```

# Example of use

`get_expander` is the main entrypoint into `exquiry`. `get_expander` is a function that returns one of the expanders implemented in the package, using the default model and arguments implemented in the package. An expander is simply something that takes in a document and produces expansions.

```python
from exquiry import get_expander

expander = get_expander("tilde")  # or 't5doc2query'
expansions = expander.expand(["Paris is the capital of France. It's where the eiffel tower is"])
print(expansions)

```

## Expander

An expander is for all intents and purposes a simple interface that exposes two functions:

### expand

Accepts `documents`, a string or list of strings, and `k`, an integer, and produces either a single list of `k` strings (if a single document was passed) or a list of list of `k` strings (if multiple documents were passed).

```python
from exquiry import get_expander

expander = get_expander("tilde")
expansions = expander.expand("Paris is the capital of France. It's where the eiffel tower is", k=5)

print(expansions)
# list of strings
# ['city', 'located', 'french', 'de', 'world']

expansions = expander.expand(["heart attack symptoms"], k=5)
print(expansions)
# list of list of strings
# [['chest', 'blood', 'include', 'signs', 'may']]

```

### expand_as_tokens

Some sparse embedder models, including [unicoil]() and [deepimpact]() use expansions during inference or indexing. Instead of concatenating these directly with the original text, these are instead added as a text input pair, i.e., separated by a `[SEP]` token from the original input text. To support this use-case, `exquiry` offers a simple helper to create these text pair encodings.

The usage is the same as `expand`, except that it also takes a tokenizer as argument. This tokenizer should be _the tokenizer used in your model_, not the tokenizer used by your expander.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

from exquiry import get_expander

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("baai/bge-m3")
expander = get_expander("tilde")
expansions = expander.expand_as_tokens(tokenizer, "Paris is the capital of France. It's where the eiffel tower is", k=5)

print(tokenizer.decode(expansions.input_ids[0]))
# "<s> Paris is the capital of France. It's where the eiffel tower is</s></s> city located french de world</s>"

# Ready to input into your model!
```

## Manual instantiation

If you want to instantiate an expander using one of your own models, you can use `get_expander_class`, and instantiate them using `from_pretrained`.

```python
from exquiry import get_expander_class

TildeClass = get_expander_class()
t = TildeClass.from_pretrained("ielab/TILDE")

# Use directly, get 10 expansions
t.expand("Paris is a great city to live in.", k=10)

```

## What about the name?

The name is a play on words: "inquiry" is semantically related to "query", and this package introduces words from outside of the query into the query. So "exquiry".

## What about the skull?

idk
