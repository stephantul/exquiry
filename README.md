  EXQUIRY
</h2>

This is a simple lexical expansion module that implements multiple methods for query or document expansion. It is intended to be used with sparse information retrieval (IR). This package does very little actual things, but groups a bunch of methods under a common framework, which can be useful for testing or comparisons.

# What is this for?

Sparse document representations suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem: documents that do not share any terms will have a similarity (or score) of 0, and will not be retrievable. This is especially difficult in the context of information retrieval, because queries and the documents that answer them do not necessarily share any tokens. For example, the query

```
"heart attack symptoms"
```

does not match the document

```
"Myocardial infarction typically presents with chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and sweating."
```

at all.

Document expansion is a simple set of techniques to counter this shortcoming: at either query or indexing time, we run document expansion models, which augment the document (i.e., either the query or the document) with additional terms. If done at indexing time, document expansion usually adds _terms that are likely to occur in the query_, while if done at query time, it usually adds synonyms and other terms that increase coverage.

For example, `tilde` (see below) will augment `"heart attack symptoms"` with:

```
'chest'
'blood'
'include'
'signs'
'may'
'pain'
'weakness'
'heartbeat'
'faint'
'breath'
```

Which leads to a non-zero similarity with the document above, because Tilde already expands the query to the actual symptoms.

# What does it contain?

It currently implements the following expanders:
- [tilde](https://github.com/ielab/TILDE)
- [doctttttquery](https://github.com/castorini/docTTTTTquery) (restyled as t5doc2query)
- [splade](https://github.com/naver/splade)

Note that `doctttttquery` is mostly suited for expanding documents into queries that relate to that documents (i.e., index-time expansion), while `tilde` and `splade` can be used for both.

The default models for all expanders are as follows:

| Expander         | Default Model                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| TILDE            | [ielab/TILDE](https://huggingface.co/ielab/TILDE)  |
| t5doc2query      | [castorini/doc2query-t5-base-msmarco](https://huggingface.co/castorini/doc2query-t5-base-msmarco) |
| SPLADE           | [naver/splade-cocondenser-ensembledistil](https://huggingface.co/naver/splade-cocondenser-ensembledistil) |

# Installation

The package is not on pypi yet, use the following:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/stephantul/exquiry.git
```

# Example of use

`get_expander` is the main entrypoint into `exquiry`. `get_expander` is a function that returns one of the expanders implemented in the package, using the default model and arguments implemented in the package. An expander is simply something that takes in a document and produces expansions.

```python
from exquiry import get_expander

expander = get_expander("tilde")  # or 't5doc2query' or 'splade'
expansions = expander.expand(["Paris is the capital of France. It's where the eiffel tower is"])
print(expansions)

```

If you want to instantiate them using one of your own models, you can use `get_expander_class`, and instantiate them using `from_pretrained`.

```python
from exquiry import get_expander_class

# Return 10 expansions
tilde = get_expander_class()

# Use directly
t.expand("Paris is a great city to live in.")

```

## What about the name?

The name is a play on words: "inquiry" is semantically related to "query", and this package introduces words from outside of the query into the query. So "exquiry".

## What about the skull?

idk
